**What is the Order of the Arrow?**
The Order of the Arrow is Scouting’s National Honor Society. Sometimes referred to as the OA, the Order recognize those Scouters who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Scout Law in their daily life.

**What's a lodge?**
Each local BSA council has their own group of the Order of the Arrow called a lodge. Similarly, each lodge has chapters representing each district in their respective Council. The chapter takes the same name as the district.

**Who runs the lodge & chapters?**
Nentego Lodge is run by the Lodge Executive Committee, which is composed of lodge officers, chapter officers, and lodge operating committee chairs. The five officers of Nentego are the Lodge Chief, the Vice Chief of Service, the Vice Chief of Program, the Vice Chief of Inductions, the Lodge Secretary, and the Lodge Treasurer. Lodge officers and chapter officers are elected for a term of one year, and operating committee chairs are appointed to the committee for the term of one year. The lodge officers, chapter chiefs, and operating committee chairs comprise the voting membership of the executive committee. All voting members are youth members, meaning they are under the age of 21.

These youth leaders are guided by a lodge adviser who is appointed by the Scout Executive. He or she then appoints associate lodge advisers, chapter advisers, and operating committee advisers to assist in this mentorship. The Scout Executive also assigns a member professional staff to serve as the lodge staff adviser. Although members of the Executive Committee, none of the adult advisers are voting members.

**How does someone become a member of the Order of the Arrow?**
The OA has different procedures for youth and adults becoming members. Youth members (under the age of 21) are elected by the other youth members of their troop, crew, or ship at an election conducted by the lodge. At least 50% of the registered youth members of the unit must be present for an election to be held. The OA is unique in this respect because candidates are elected by OA members and non-OA members alike. Adult members (over the age of 21) are nominated by the unit committee and the nomination is forwarded to lodge adviser for consideration.

**What are the requirements for becoming a member of the Order of the Arrow?**
To be considered for election, a youth must be a registered member of a troop, crew, or ship. Scouts BSA members must have achieved the rank of First Class, Venturers must have been recognized with the Discovery Award, and Sea Scouts must have reached the Ordinary rank. Each candidate must have unit leader approval and have a minimum of 15 days and nights of Scouting camping under the auspices of the Boy Scouts of America, including one long term camping experience within the two years prior to the election. With the exception of the rank requirement, and adult nominee must meet the same camping and membership requirements.

**How many elections can my unit have per year?**
Each unit is entitled to one election each year. The lodge calendar runs from January 1st through September 30th, and each troop, crew, or ship may have only one election during that time period.

**How do I arrange a unit election?**
Each year, the chapter election teams will start contacting each unit leader in their district to set up an election. If your unit is not contacted about scheduling an election, you are encouraged to contact your chapter adviser of the lodge adviser to schedule one immediately.

**How many adults may my unit nominate?**
The number of adults nominated can be no more than one-third of the number of youth candidates elected, rounded up where the number of youth candidates is not a multiple of three. In addition to the one-third limit, the unit committee may nominate the currently serving unit leader (but not assistant leaders), as long as he or she has served as unit leader for at least the previous twelve months.

**Once elected, am I member?**
Election into the Order of the Arrow is only the first step in your membership journey. Once elected, you must complete your Ordeal to be considered a full member of the OA. For more information regarding the Ordeal and other information for elected candidates, check out the [Elected Candidates](/electedcandidates) page.

**Are there yearly dues for the Order of the Arrow?**
In order to be considered a member in good standing, members of Nentego Lodge must pay their lodge dues annually. Yearly dues help support the lodge operating budget, give each member the right to wear a lodge flap, and allow you the ability to participate in lodge activies.

**I am moving out of the Council, is my OA membership transferable?**
Your membership is absolutely transferable to another lodge. Once you’re settled in and registered in your new council, have their lodge contact us for your membership record. Once you’re registered in your new lodge and council, you can no longer remain a member of Nentego Lodge as you can only belong to one lodge at a time – per National policy.

**Do I have to be registered in the BSA to be member of the lodge?**
YES. You must be registered as a unit, district, or council level Scout or Scouter to be considered an active member of the lodge and participate in lodge events, in addition to having your dues paid. All members 18 years of age and older must also have a valid Youth Protection training certificate.
