<h3 class="mt-5">Zoom</h3>
Zoom is great for hybrid in person & remote collaboration.  As such, this is what we use for things like Lodge Executive Committee meetings.

If you would like to use the Lodge's Zoom room, reach out to the [#Communications](https://unamilodge.slack.com/archives/C4RN3NCTS) committee, and we'll be happy to get you setup with a link.


<h3 class="mt-5">Google Meet</h3>
If self service video conferencing is more your speed, Google Meet is a great option.  Just head to [Meet.Google.com](https://meet.google.com/), make sure you're using your @UnamiLodge.org Google Workspace account (top right of the page), and off you go!

Google Meet supports web and phone app video conferencing, as well as "old school" phone dial-in.

To schedule a Meet ahead of time, create an event in your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and select "Add Google Meet video conferencing."
