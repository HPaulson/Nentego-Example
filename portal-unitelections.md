Thank you for your interest in completing a unit election in Nentego Lodge. New members are vital to the continued success of our organization. All units are encouraged to hold a visitation each year, even if there are no eligible candidates. Learn more about the different parts of an election below.

## Requesting an Election/Visitation
All Troops, Ships, and Crews within the Del-Mar-Va Council are eligible to hold one unit election per calendar year.

If you would like to schedule a unit election or visitation prior to receiving a request email, please contact [your chapter](/find).


## Conducting an Election
Once you've requested an election, a team from your chapter of Nentego Lodge will work with you to schedule a date and location. To ensure a successful election, please announce the date in advance to your unit members so they will be sure to attend that evening. Remember, at least 50% of your unitâ€™s active members must be present to conduct an election. Any Arrowmen in your unit are encouraged to wear their OA sash on the night of the election.

    Please note - you may not complete an election for your own unit. Please continue to attend your unit meeting and participate in the election, but the visitation must be completed by other Arrowmen.

## Recording Election Results
Upon the completion of your unit election, election teams will confirm the results with the unit leader. Results can either be announced that night, or held for future announcement at a call-out. If held, a date must be chosen as to when results can be announced. ***Keep in mind - the clock on the candidate's induction opportunity starts at the time of election, not announcement.***

Elected candidates, both youth and adult, will receive further information from Nentego Lodge about completing their ordeal. Additional information for elected candidates can be found [here](/electedcandidates). Candidates have up to 24 months from election to complete their induction.
