## December 6-8, 2019

This Lodge Leadership Development (LLD) will not be one to miss! On the heels of [National OA's committment to Thrive](https://oa-bsa.org/article/thrive-national-webinar-local-commitment), we will be tackling the ambitious answer to "What's Next?" Many hands make light work, and getting many voices in on this discussion will surely help move the conversation forward.

Many of the conversations and trainings will help participants learn how to better support the Lodge, Scouting, and many other communities they may find themselves a part of.
