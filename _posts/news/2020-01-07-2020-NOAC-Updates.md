If you did not yet catch the last promotion of this event, make sure to [learn more from our last article](/news/2020-NOAC).

The theme has been announced! "Step Up, Step Forward" is this years theme, so take heed!

National OA has also announced the availability of a [Remote Delegate Program](https://oa-bsa.org/article/noac-2020-remote-delegate-program). If you cannot make it to NOAC for any reason, this a great idea for you! It's NOAC from the comfort of your home or office all day every day live streaming events.

We are doing everything we can to make the experience as great as it can be for as low a cost as possible. One way is the sale of a [Fundraiser Flap for NOAC so check that out in our store](https://unami-lodge-one.square.site/)! Also make sure to stay tuned for a **Trivia Night Saturday, May 9**. This event is only open to adults, but youth are more than able to participate by telling your their about it!
