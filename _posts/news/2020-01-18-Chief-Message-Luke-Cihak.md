Brothers,

I am incredibly honored to be able to serve as the 2020 Lodge Chief of Unami Lodge, One. Currently I am working at the Philadelphia Protestant Home while I take a break from school this year. I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 563 in Northeast Philadelphia and have been in scouting since 2008. For the last 6 summers I have been a member of the Resica Falls Camp Staff working in a variety of areas, including Ecology, STEM, and the Native American Village. I also volunteered my free time to help out with the OA program at camp and will take the role of OA Coordinator this summer. Working on camp staff is an experience that changed my life for the better and it is something I would recommend to anyone.

I completed my Ordeal in the summer of 2013 at Resica Falls. My involvement in the OA began as Roosevelt Chapter Secretary, and after experiencing what the Lodge has to offer I began to take on other leadership roles, such as Chapter Chief, Lodge Secretary and Vice Chief of Chapters and Lodge Operations Chair. The growth and friendships I was able to gain from these roles, as well as my time on camp staff, are irreplaceable and I will treasure them deeply for the rest of my life. This past summer I kept my Vigil, also at Resica Falls.

I truly believe in our lodge leadership team for the 2020 year. We have talented chapter chiefs, chairs, and officers who are ready and excited to take on the challenges the future of our organization faces. We also have many talented adult advisers who are willing and able to guide the youth. The best way you can get involved in all of this is to come to events! Our first weekend will be April 3-5 at Musser SR. Hopefully I will see you all there. Also make sure you pay your dues! The early bird ends soon!

Yours in Brotherhood,<br>
Luke Cihak<br>
