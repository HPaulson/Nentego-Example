Congratulations to our 52 newest members!

On October 10th, we celebrated the induction of our first new members in 2020! These new members left their mark in Camp Hart by cleaning up a wide range of areas from broken water pipes to broken trees. Some [pictures of these works and others are available to view](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmRBPbgG){:target="_blank"}.

Some opportunities and events for us to all keep an eye out for:
- Learn about your chapter and find out how you can get involved at [unamilodge.org/chapters/find](/chapters/find){:target="_blank"}
- [Lodge Officer Elections October 26-31](/news/2021-Officer-Elections)
- Stay tuned for a Service Day on November 14 at Resica Falls Scout Reservation
- Stay tuned for an upcoming virtual fellowship event (Date TBD)
- Stay tuned for another induction weekend (Elangomats are always wanted! Dates TBD)

Updates will be made to this article as information about those events is finalized. Also stayed tuned on our calendar at [unamilodge.org/calendar](/calendar){:target="_blank"}.
