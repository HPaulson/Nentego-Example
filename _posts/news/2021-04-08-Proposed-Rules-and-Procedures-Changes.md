The following proposed Rules & Procedures changes shall be voted upon by general lodge membership at Spring Service 1:

- [Readability and National Changes](/files/rules/proposed_sept19/readablity_and_national_changes.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- [Budget Approval Change](/files/rules/proposed_sept19/budget_approval_changes.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- *Motion:* Change Article 3 Section 2 Clause D of Rules and procedures to “A Scout troop, Venturing Crew, or Sea Scout ship may request one election at any point during the months of January through September”
    - *Why this change:* by implementing a change in an election time frame, units will be unable to continually push elections off, and will better allow for inductions to take place close to inductees Elections.
