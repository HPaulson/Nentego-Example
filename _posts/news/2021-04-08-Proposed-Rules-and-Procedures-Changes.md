excerpt: Proposed rules and procedures changes to be voted upon during Fall Fellowship 2019.
---

The following proposed Rules & Procedures changes shall be voted upon by general lodge membership at Fall Fellowship 2019:

- [Readability and National Changes](/files/rules/proposed_sept19/readablity_and_national_changes.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- [Budget Approval Change](/files/rules/proposed_sept19/budget_approval_changes.pdf){:target="_blank"}

**Update:** The general members meeting did not include a vote on the rules and procedures due to a procedural mistake with the required LEC vote. The lodge operations committee apologizes for this mistake and will take steps to ensure it will not happen again. A vote on these changes will happen at a later date. Thank you.
