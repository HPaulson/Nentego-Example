We kicked the rust off at Spring Service 1; now let's get to work at our second spring service helping prepare for summer camp.

This coming Spring Service we will be working on projects at [Resica Falls Scout Reservation](https://resicafalls.org). Fellowship events will center around the mystery theme, so bring your sleuthing skills!

Don't forget there are plenty of other ways to serve our camps [on our calendar](/calendar), so check them out!

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or concerns at [events@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=events)
