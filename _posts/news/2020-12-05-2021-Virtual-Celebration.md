Formerly the 105th Annual Lodge Dinner, the challenges of this past year gave us reason to seek a new opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of our Lodge and its members.

This year's "dinner" was an at home feature that premiered on YouTube.  If you didn't get a chance to watch live, be sure to check out the recording for classic favorites such as the State of the Lodge, Award Recognitions, the Induction of the 2021 Officers, and as always the most exciting news!

Stay tuned for more details! Dues notices, turtle power passes, and many more opportunities will be coming soon!
