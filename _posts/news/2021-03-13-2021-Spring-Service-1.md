It's been a while since we've all been together in person. Come join us for the first traditional service weekend as a Lodge in over a year! The theme is *Earth, Sea, and Sky* to celebrate the great outdoors in all its various wonder.

This coming Spring Service we will be working on projects at [Musser Scout Reservation](https://mussersr.org) to help prepare them for their [long list of events](https://mussersr.org/calendar) this Spring, Summer, and Fall.

Don't forget there are plenty of other ways to serve our camps [on our calendar](/calendar), so check them out!

If you have not yet signed up for the [Turtle Power Pass](https://colbsa.doubleknot.com/event/2021-turtle-pass/2589408), you still have time to save money and guarantee a spot at the rest of our weekends! This deal ends March 31, but make sure not to forget!

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or concerns at [events@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=events)
