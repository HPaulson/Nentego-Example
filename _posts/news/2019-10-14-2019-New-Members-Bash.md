## Friday, Nov. 15th

- Are you a new member?
- Have you recently sealed the bond of Brotherhood?
- Are you interested in finding out what the OA is all about?
- Are you free to meet new people and have fun the evening of Friday the 15th?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions then the New Members Bash is right for you!

The new members' bash will have food and activities to keep you warm on a Novemember Friday evening. Representatives from every chapter and committee will be in attendance to help welcome you to the Lodge as well as answer any questions and help you get more involved.

Can't wait till then? Reach out to [anyone from our team](/contactlist) to see how you can get more involved.

More information will be coming in shortly as plans are finalized, but mark your calendars and save the date!
