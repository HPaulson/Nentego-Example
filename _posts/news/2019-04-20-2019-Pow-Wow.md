I invite you all to come join us for the 4th annual Pow-Wow In The Park on Wednesday night, May 22nd starting at 5pm. This great event is being hosted by Roosevelt, Northern, Baden Powell, and Washington Order of the Arrow Chapters. There will be food, games, activities, fellowship and much more. The best part is that the event is **FREE** for everyone! Bring your friends, family, brothers or sisters for this amazing event. 

The Pow-Wow will take place at Lorimer Park, located at 183 Moredon Road in Huntingdon Valley, PA. The more people, the better. I hope to see you all there for this amazing **FREE** event! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me.
