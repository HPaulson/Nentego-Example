This is a new year for many of us including the Lodge! Join us (or invite an elected candidate) for the first induction event of the year! Our Lodge has battled the twists and turns of this year and we have finally found an opportunity for those members of our scouting community most worthy of joining Scouting's Honor Society to find the safest opportunity to join us.

This event is extremely limited so please sign up fast! For more information about the ordeal and the Order of the Arrow, please see our [page for elected candidates](/electedcandidates/).

Any and all questions can be answered at [ordeal@UnamiLodge.org](/contact?recipient=ordeal).
