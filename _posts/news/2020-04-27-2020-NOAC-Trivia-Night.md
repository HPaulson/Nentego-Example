*This event has been canceled but stay tuned for our Virtual Trivia Night on the same time and day!* We'll be sure to post an article when we have more information and you can always stay up to date with our events at [UnamiLodge.org/calendar](/calendar)! Don't forget, [we still have a flap for sale to help pay for our youth to go to NOAC](/news/NOAC-LOVE-Fundraiser-Flap) this summer!

**Join us for a fun night of trivia to benefit Unami Lodge, Oneâ€™s youth program!**
 
In August 2020, [Unami, One will be attending the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC)](/news/2020-NOAC-Updates) at Michigan State University. This fundraiser is to raise funds and reduce the normal cost for youth that want to attend. The trivia night fundraiser will be held on May 9, 2020 at [St. Catherine of Siena Church in Horsham, PA](https://goo.gl/maps/2BsrLfnybkJXB1927). Doors will open at 6:45 PM, and the cost of the event is $25.00 which includes snacks and a light dinner. Leave the kids at home for this wonderfully mind-twisting fellowship event; this event is BYOB! Trivia night is open to any and all adults 21 and over that wish to help contribute to this endeavor. **(Scouting involvement not required!)**
