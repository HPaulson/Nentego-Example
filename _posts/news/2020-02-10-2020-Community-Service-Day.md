As some of you know, the Lodgeâ€™s annual Community Service Day is coming up next month! On Saturday, March 21st members of Unami Lodge, One, and Cradle of Liberty Council (Yes, it is open to non-OA members) are invited to attend community service projects at two locations within Cradle of Liberty Council. Service projects will consist of clearing brush, raking leaves, cutting branches, cleaning up trash, and setting up for spring season at the following locations...

- [Lorimer Park (183 Moredon Rd, Huntingdon Valley, PA 19006)](https://goo.gl/maps/aDPYj2ULDnA1jVuk6)
- [Mount Moriah Cemetery (1004 Cobbs Creek Pkwy, Yeadon, PA 19050)](https://goo.gl/maps/RXTWMzFVSZbZ75ou9)
- [Nor Gwyn Baseball Association (145 Hancock Rd, North Wales, PA 19454)](https://goo.gl/maps/MqRqWA7otWeBSzhs5)

Check-in for the service projects will be between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, with the projects being finished around 3:00 PM. Please wear appropriate attire for the work projects. Anyone is more than welcome to bring their own yard tools. Lunch will not be provided, so individuals may pack a lunch or snack, or units that are attending together may have members volunteer to bring snacks. It would be a great help for any registered scouts or scouters to attend, and make sure you spread the word in your Chapter, Troop, Ship, or Crew! Remember that the event is open to everyone so encourage them to attend as well.
