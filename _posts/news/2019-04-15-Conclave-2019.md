excerpt: It's time to hit it out of the park! Join us for Section NE-5's 2019 Conclave, Major League Brotherhood.
---

Come join Unami Lodge and the 10 other lodges for the Section NE-5 Conclave! This year’s Conclave will be hosted by Ajapeu Lodge 2 on June 7 - 9 at Camp Ockanickon in Bucks County. For those of you who don’t know what Conclave is, it is an annual gathering of the eleven Lodges that make up Section NE-5, to learn more about the OA &amp; discover new techniques for improving our own lodge, by attending training on Saturday morning followed by fun and fellowship in the afternoon and a show Saturday evening. The fellowship is pretty unique too, because, as a Lodge participant, you get to play games and meet people from all over the section, which is an awesome experience. 

This year’s theme for Conclave is Major League Brotherhood, a spin-off of Major League Baseball, which is sure to entail some really interesting fellowship. Another big thing about the Conclave is that, as a participant, you get to participate in electing next year’s Section leadership, which is a very unique experience. 

The registration deadline for this awesome event is May 31, and you can register and pre-order conclave merchandise at [http://unamilodge.org/conclave](unamilodge.org/conclave). Just a reminder, you must sign up through the link, because, as Conclave is a Section event and not a Lodge event, registration must occur through a centralized registration system instead of the Unami’s registration system. If you have any questions, please email me at [riley.metzler@unamilodge.org](/contact#riley.metzler), or Larry Neibauer at [lneibauer@unamilodge.org](/contact#lneibauer).
