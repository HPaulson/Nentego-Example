Do you want to meet thousands of Arrowmen from across the country? Are you interested in learning about the future of the OA? Are you an avid patch collector? Then join us for the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC)!  NOAC is the premier event of the Order of the Arrow and is Scouting’s second-largest national event. In 2020, several thousand Arrowmen from across our nation will gather at Michigan State University on August 2 – 9 to participate in this once in a lifetime event. This National event features:

- World Class Training
- Lodge Competitions
- Ceremony Competitions
- Shows and Fellowship
- A Day at Cedar Point Park - *the roller coaster capital of the United States*
- Patch Trading

The cost of the event will be $700.00 for a youth under 21 and $750 for all adults. The best part is the first 40 people to register for the event will get a **free limited-edition duffel bag**.

Did I forget to mention Patch Trading.......
