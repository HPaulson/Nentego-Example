Fall Fellowship will be held the first weekend of October at [Musser Scout Reservation](https://mussersr.org). Fall Fellowship is an especially exciting Lodge weekend because it combines the the cheerful service with fun fellowship. This year's fall fellowship we return to our tradition of electing new officers so it should be particularly interesting for new members and experienced members alike!

Don't forget there are plenty of other ways to serve our camps [on our calendar](/calendar), so check them out!

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or concerns at [events@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=events)
