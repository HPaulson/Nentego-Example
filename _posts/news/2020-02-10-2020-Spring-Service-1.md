Are you willing to step up and take the challenge? Test your wits at this Spring Service! Don't worry; we will be eating better than the typical cast of Survivor.

This coming Spring Service we will be working on projects at [Musser Scout Reservation](https://mussersr.org) to help prepare them for their [long list of events](https://mussersr.org/calendar) this Spring, Summer, and Fall.

The Ceremonies Committee is recruiting new youth members to serve as ceremonialists. Arrowmen that enjoy building amazing fires and settings to hold ceremonies are also needed to help serve on the Ceremonial Grounds Crew. [Contact the Ceremoies Committee](/contact?recipient=ceremonies) now for more information!

If you have not yet signed up for the [Turtle Power Pass](/news/2020-Dues-and-Power-Pass), you still have time to save money and guarantee a spot at the rest of our weekends! This deal ends March 31, but make sure not to forget!

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or concerns at [events@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=events)
