Unami Lodge, One is dedicated to maintaining and improving our Camp facilities.  Please join us to make our service day a productive endeavor.  The OA has been providing service to the Cradle of Liberty Council and its camps for over 105 years.  Without this service the Council would be unable to provide the excellent program it offers to so many youth throughout the year.  In order for the Lodge to provide this level of service, *WE NEED YOUR HELP*. 

We ask you to come and share the day of brotherhood, service, fellowship, and FUN.

**Please bring a bag lunch, no meals will be provided.** 

Check-in will be in the Camp Garrison Parking Lot at 4021 Upper Ridge Road
