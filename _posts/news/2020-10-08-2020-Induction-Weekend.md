Hello Everyone!

Thank you for registering to complete your ordeal in Unami Lodge, at the Fall Ordeal Weekend at Musser Scout Reservation – Camp Hart this coming weekend, Friday October 9th – Saturday October 10th.  We are looking forward to seeing you this weekend and joining our lodge.

Because of Covid-19, there are specific procedures that will need to be followed, so we wanted to get a communication out to each of you to break it down for you so everyone is aware of our safety measures:

**First and foremost, if you are not feeling well and/or have a temperature of 100F or higher you must stay home.** We appreciate your enthusiasm, but we want you to rest-up and feel better and not spread your illness to others.
During the weekend, we will be following all COVID safety procedures, so be sure to **wear your mask at all times** and maintain a 6ft distance from others when possible.

## Check-IN Process

- Between 6:00pm and 9:00pm vehicles with candidates will gather in the Camp Hart parking lot, an event staff member will direct you where to line up
  - Everyone is asked to remain in their car until directed by the staff member to move to check-in.
- When directed, and you arrive at the check-in area, the candidate will go to the check-in table.
  - For safety reasons, all others please remain in their vehicle.
- The Candidate should have the following with them: 
  - COVID 19 Screening Questionnaire, [please fill this out before coming to the event](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOQwzgRHTjeNazHFIY9_yl63192nllqwsivWf092Pto/edit){:target="_blank"}
  - [Parts A&B of the BSA Medical Form](https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/ahmr/){:target="_blank"}
  - Be aware that your temperature will be taken, and anyone with a temperature at or above 100F will not be allowed to stay in camp.
- Once given the OK to enter camp, the candidate should retrieve their horseshoe pack, say goodnight to their ride and proceed to the assigned area.  Vehicles should drive safely from the check-in area as to allow for the next candidate to check-in.

## Check-OUT Process

- Pick-up vehicles should arrive to pick-up their scout(s) NO sooner than 6:30pm and park in the Camp Hart parking lot.
- All new members will be released on Saturday evening after their induction ceremony around 6:30pm, grab their horseshoe pack and proceed to the parking lot for pick-up.

Please understand that this will be our first ordeal weekend during these very different times, and we are striving to maintain the safety of yourselves, your family, our staff, and other campers in camp for the weekend.

Yours in Scouting,  
Unami Lodge Ordeal Committee
