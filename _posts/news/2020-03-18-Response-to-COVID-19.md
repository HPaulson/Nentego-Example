<strong>March 18, 2020 - 7:00PM EST - Lodge-Wide Communication</strong>

Due to the current health crisis, the Cradle of Liberty Council Program Committee has decided to postpone or cancel all in-person events until at least April 30th.

This includes our upcoming Community Service Day, and Spring Service 1 weekend that was to be held at Musser Scout Reservation. It is a not an easy decision but one that is believed to be in the best interest of our members, our loved ones, and our community. This suspension of activities will also apply to Chapter Meetings and Unit Elections.

Units are being advised of how they should handle meetings and activities by Cradle of Liberty Council at [colbsa.org/coronavirus](https://colbsa.org/coronavirus), but the Lodge has suspended all Unit Elections through the end of March, and will begin again April 1st by only using video conferencing solutions until further notice.

We are aware that this may not answer every question and a few decisions have yet to be made, but all information regarding changes to our program will be made available when they are known right here, and at [UnamiLodge.org/coronavirus](#).

Thank you for your understanding during these trying times.

Yours in Brotherhood,  
Luke Cihak  
Lodge Chief
