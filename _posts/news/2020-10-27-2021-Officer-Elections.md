To Youth of Unami Lodge,

Due to the pandemic, the Lodge Key 3, the Supreme Chief of the Fire and the Lodge Operations Committee have created a new innovative way to conduct our Lodge Elections Virtually. The elections are going to be split up across a week this year. Each voting period will be exactly 12 hours and the results will be sent out via email/social media livestream the next day. All youth members in Unami Lodge will be sent a google form to the email they registered with in lodgemaster (This form will only be sent to the primary email that you have signed up with). If you have any questions about what email was used to join the lodge, please email [LodgeOperations@UnamiLodge.org](/contact?recipient=lodgeoperations). It is very important that you use the same email that was sent to you to vote for this upcoming election because votes coming from email that we do not recognize in lodge master will not be counted. If you and a fellow arrowman share an email address make sure you send an email to Lodge Operations so they do not count your vote as a duplicate. *If we are not aware of any relationship that was stated then only the first vote of the duplicate emails will be counted.* The times listed below  are when the Lodge Elections are going to happen. Thank you all for your patience during these difficult times in the lodge. Below is a list of what constitutes suspicious activity and what will happen if these things occur. We hope that you can take time out of your day to participate in the democracy that makes our lodge thrive. The speeches will be included in the google form that will be sent out.
