Join us this new year at the Lodge's 104th Annual Dinner! This is one of the oldest traditions of not only Unami Lodge, but across the nation in the Order of the Arrow. At this dinner we will celebrate this past year with awards and recognitions. We will look forward to this coming year with the State of the Lodge and good food filling us.

**The Roaring 20's** is the theme; it's sure to be a classy affair, so bring some culture! As always with the annual dinner, friends and family are more than welcome to join! Patch auctions, and door prizes will be available so make sure to arrive on time.

If you have any questions, let the dinner committee know at [dinner@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=dinner).
