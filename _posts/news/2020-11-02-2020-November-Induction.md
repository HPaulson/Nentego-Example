This is a new year for many of us including the Lodge! Join us for the second and last induction event of the year, November 13-14! Our Lodge has battled the twists and turns of this year and the last induction weekend was quite popular! Because of that popularity, we found an opportunity for those members of our scouting community most worthy of joining Scoutingâ€™s Honor Society to find the safest opportunity to join us.

This event is extremely limited so please sign up fast! This will be the last opportunity of the year as the weather becomes more intense. For more information about the Ordeal and the Order of the Arrow, see our page for elected candidates.

Any and all questions can be answered at ordeal@UnamiLodge.org.
