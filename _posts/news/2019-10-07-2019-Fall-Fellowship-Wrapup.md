This fall fellowship was an absolute blast! A lot of service was done and even more fellowship was had! Our highland games featured a [caber toss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caber_toss){:target="_blank"}, speedy cup stacking, bucket basketball, and a moon bounce! Another exciting feature of this weekend was the [annual officer elections](/news/2020-Lodge-Officers)! Make sure to congratulate next year's officers when you see them! By the numbers there were well over 200 arrowmen in attendance this weekend with 38 newly inducted members and 15 sealing their bond of Brotherhood! Congratulations to all of you as well!
